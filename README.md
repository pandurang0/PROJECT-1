**Prerequisites:**

Use of Tkinter libraries in Python to create a basic calculator.

**Project Details:**

The project is to build a GUI-based simple working calculator.

**Work done on the project:**

•	First, I referred to the website geeksforgeeks for coding and its implementation.

•	Then I used Tkinter module to create all the basic functionalities of the calculator. Initially, I got a few syntax errors. In one or two cases, I had used semicolons instead of colons. I also corrected upper and lower cases.

•	I created all the required functionalities after referring to the training material provided.

•	calculator.py is my notebook, where the entire coding is done.

•	A PPT (GUI-based Calculator) is also attached here.
